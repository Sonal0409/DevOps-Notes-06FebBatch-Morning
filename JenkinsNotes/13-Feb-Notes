Jenkins Triggers.
     To automatically execute a jenkins job, you will use Jenkins triggers
       Based on:

      Periodic time- schedule
      Whenever there is a commit in github repo
      A parent job can trigger execution of child job
      Execute a job from remote script

You will go to build triggered section in the job to set up a trigger for automatic execution of the job


Trigger prieodically
