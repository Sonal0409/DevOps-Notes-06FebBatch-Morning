 How to integrate Jenkins with Github repository

> Connect to AWS ec2 machine- Start the server & start jenkins
> Execute command : 
 sudo su -
systemctl start jenkins
Go to browser : give public ip ofec2 server:8080
http://3.144.203.98:8080/

Demo 1: Create a Jenkisn job that will clone a github repository in jenkins workspace

Click on Build now

Repository will be cloned in jenkins workspace

You can go to job → workspace folder to see the files


Jenkins Triggers.
     To automatically execute a jenkins job, you will use Jenkins triggers
       Based on:

      Periodic time- schedule
      Whenever there is a commit in github repo
      A parent job can trigger execution of child job
      Execute a job from remote script

You will go to build triggered section in the job to set up a trigger for automatic execution of the job


Trigger prieodically

Go to Job Clone repo --> build trigger--> build preodically --> give */2 * * * * --> Save and build now


All build will be generated automatically every 2 mins


Build Triggers--> Poll SCM --> * * * * *

Build will be generated each time there is a chnage in the repository only.

Webhook:
Webhooks allow Jenkins to be notified when certain events happen on the repo. When the specified events happen, we’ll send a POST request to each of the URLs you provide.
