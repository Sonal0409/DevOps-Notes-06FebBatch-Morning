Master and slave architecture in Jenkins






Create a linux slave and dispatch job from master to slave

Create a new EC2 instance with OS as Amazon linux 2
Provide the security group rule 2 also.

Connect to the instance and install following tools:

Execute command to become root

sudo su -

Java:

sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y

GIT:

yum install git -y

            Create a root directory
This directory will be used exclusively my Jenkisn master to place remote files and create job workspace
You need to create a directory and give read/write/execute access to it

Execute:

$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir jenkinsdir

The path of root directory will be /tmp/jenkinsdir

give read/write/execute access to the root directory

$ chmod -R 777 /tmp/jenkinsdir

**********************************************

Setup on Jenkins master:

Go to manage jenkins → Configure system → Scroll down to jenkins location and change the Jenkisn URL to be the latest URL

http://3.147.195.251:8080/

Save the page


2. Manage jenkins → configure global security→ scroll down → Agents → select Random radio button

Save the page


Manage Jenkins – Manage nodes and Clouds

Click on + New node

Give node name: slave1

Select Permanent Agent

Click on create

Now give description : anything text

Number of executors: 1

Remote root directory: /tmp/jenkinsdir


Labels : slave1

Usage : select second option from dropdown

Launch method: launch agents via ssh

Host : private ip address of slave machine
Add credentials.

Scroll down to Node properties
Select tool location:

Click on ADD

Now go to slave server and execute command

$ which git

Path of git will be 

/usr/bin/git


Now add Java


On slave execute :  alternatives --config java

Give number of version 11 java

Copy the path of verison 11


Go to jenkins and paste the path






Windows Agent:

restart the instance.
Restart the jenkins server
now take public ip and loginto jenkins

Step 1: Go to Manage Jenkins ---> CONFIGURE SYSTEM ---> Check the Jenkins URL is same as URL of browser --> Save
Step 2: Go to Manage Jenkins---> CONFIGURE GLOBAL SECURITY --> Scroll down to AGENTS-->select RANDOM radiobutton--> Save
Step 3: Go to Manage Jenkins---> MAnage Nodes and Clouds  --> New Node

Select New Node--> give name as Winslave--> select radio button permanamet Agent

Name : winslave
Description: give windows 10 machine 
==> # of executors = 1 ==> means number of jobs that we want to run on this slave node. Let it be 1 for now
===> Remote root directory ==> C:\jenkinsdir
Location of a directory folder on your windows machine , so that jenkins can create a workspace folder and store all the files. As we have seen earlier while executiong jobs.
For this --> got to C drive and create an emapty folder.
C:\jenkinsdir

====>  Label : win_slave ==> this is like a tag to slave machine. This is how we will identify the slave machine--> remeber this

===> Usage: 
Select 2nd option: Only build jobs with label expressionmatching the job :
This means for which ever job we will give label as win_slave that job only will run on this job.

===> Launch Method : select option : Launch agent by connecting to master.

Scroll down

Add tools

Add git path as C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe
